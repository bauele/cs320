## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my product is functional by writing unit tests to prove that the software operates as expected under the provided input conditions. I use both black box and white box testing techniques to examine my software from multiple angles, making improvements as necessary.

I ensure my program is secure by following industry standard best practices. Specifically, I make sure to include error checking where the program might throw an error. I make sure that web applications are communicating over HTTPS. I also encrypt any personal information that may need to be saved to a data persistence layer. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by reviewing the list of requirements for a given program or feature. I may also consider these requirements in the context of use cases, so that I can put myself in the user's position and understand what they are hoping to accomplish. Once I have established this, I write unit tests to prove that a behavior or requirement is functioning as described  by the specification. 

## How do I approach designing software?
As aforementioned, I begin by reviewing the requirements and ensuring that I understand them and what their overall purpose is. I examine how the requirements may work together to form a larger picture. I write tests against these requirements to ensure that I am able to prove my software is doing what it is expected to do.
